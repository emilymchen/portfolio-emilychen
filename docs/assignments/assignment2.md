# Assignment 2: Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

**App Name**: ReWear

**Intended Audience:** Fashion enthusiasts who want to stay stylish while being mindful about their environmental impact and purchasing habits.

**Value:** Unlike other clothing- or fashion-centric apps, ReWear will encourage users to balance their sense of style with sustainable consumption habits. While a lot of existing fashion apps promote purchasing new clothes or trying trendy styles, ReWear will help users repurpose their existing wardrobe pieces, connect with donation centers, and showcase their style without promoting overconsumption.

## Scrapbook of Comparables

### Depop

![depop](/../assets/images/depop.png)

Depop allows users to shop for different price points and styles of clothings. Could we use a similar UI and style categories to allow users to easily browse for clothes that are donated by other users?

### Duolingo

![duolingo](/../assets/images/duolingo.jpg)

Duolingo makes language learning fun with gamification. Could we implement similar levels, points, and rewards to make sustainability fun and encourage people to shop sustainability?

### Facebook Marketplace

![facebookmktplace](/../assets/images/facebookmarketplace.png)

Facebook Marketplace recommends top picks of items in a certain radius from where you live. Could we implement similar location-based tracking to allow users to only browse clothes that are feasible/convenient for them to pick up?

### Good On You

![goodonyou](/../assets/images/goodonyou.png)

Good On You posts reviews of companies based on price points and eco-ratings. Could we use a similar UI to allow users to browse for sustainable companies and check whether companies they are interested in are eco-friendly?

### Google Maps

![googlemaps](/../assets/images/googlemaps.png)

Google Maps' UI allows users to easily browse for things like thrift shops in their area. Could we build a similar feature into our app so users can find things like thrift shops, donation centers, and clothing repair places in their local community?

### Indyx

![indyx](/../assets/images/indyx.png)

Indyx has a calendar app that allows users to see what outfits they wore over the past month. Could a similar UI be used to allow users to easily see what clothes they are wearing often?

### Pinterest

![pinterest](/../assets/images/pinterest.png)

Pinterest has a scroll feature where users can see and save posts that they like, and can browse other posts that interest/inspire them. Could we use a similar feature to allow users to pin and save styles they like and browse other users' outfits of the day?

## Brainstorming Feature Ideas

**Collaborators:** I brainstormed with Sabrina Do.

### 1. **Green Impact Calculator**

This tool calculates the environmental impact of users’ fashion choices over time, such as the amount of carbon dioxide saved by delaying purchases, buying second-hand, or donating items. The calculator could display stats on how sustainable decisions affect water usage, waste reduction, and energy savings over time in order to motivate the user to stay on track with sustainable actions.

### 2. **Sustainability Rating for Companies**

Users can view sustainability scores for clothing brands, based on ethical labor practices, environmental impact, and materials used, which provides transparency in making informed shopping decisions so users know which brands are actually sustainable and ethical vs "greenwashed".

### 3. **Local Clothing Donation Finder**

This feature helps users find local donation centers on a map, or opportunities to list items for swapping/donation directly through the app, encouraging local exchanges and minimizing waste.

### 4. **AI-Powered Clothing Posting**

Machine learning is used to reduce the effort of posting clothes by automatically recognizing the brand, type, and name of clothing items. This minimizes friction in listing items for donation or resale, since users are often put-off from listing clothes online because of how much work it is to input large amounts of clothes into a system.

### 5. **Purchase Pause Button**

A mindfulness tool where users can add desired items to a “purchase pause” list. After a set period (e.g., 3 days), the app asks if they still want the item, encouraging thoughtful purchasing and reducing impulse buys.

### 6. **Declutter Challenges**

Users participate in weekly or monthly challenges focused on eco-fashion, such as creating outfits using only recycled or thrifted items. Top participants earn badges, recognition, or rewards, fostering a fun, competitive environment around sustainable fashion.

### 7. **Outfit of the Day (OOTD)**

Users post daily outfits showcasing how they’ve styled their existing wardrobe in creative ways. The OOTD section emphasizes using what users already own, helping reduce the desire to purchase new items and building a community around styling challenges.

### 8. **Clothing Lifecycle Tracker**

This tool tracks how long users have owned each clothing item and provides suggestions for extending their life, such as repair tips or repurposing ideas. Items nearing the end of their lifecycle can be flagged for donation or upcycling.

### 9. **Style Boards**

Users can organize outfit inspirations, eco-friendly fashion tips, and sustainable brand recommendations into personalized boards. These style boards help users track their sustainable fashion journey and visualize new ways to wear their clothes without purchasing more.

### 10. **Price-Per-Wear Calculator**

The app calculates how much value users get from an item based on how often they wear it. This encourages users to buy high-quality items that will last, and discourages cheap fast-fashion purchases.

### 11. **Virtual Closet**

A digital organization tool that helps users catalog their wardrobe. Users can track and sort what they already own, making it easier to see what items are being underutilized and what might be suitable for donation or restyling.

### 12. **Wear Counter**

Tracks how often users wear specific clothing items. Frequently worn items are highlighted, while underused items prompt reminders to either wear them more often or consider donating them.

### 13. **Declutter Goals & Progress Tracking**

Users set personal decluttering goals (e.g., reducing their wardrobe by 20%) and track their progress over time. The app provides accountability and reminders to help users achieve their goals, promoting a minimalist lifestyle.

### 14. **Minimal Feed**

A stripped-down social media feed that reduces clutter by limiting product recommendations and fast fashion ads. The feed focuses instead on user-generated content related to styling, sustainable tips, and fashion challenges.

### 15. **Clothing Repair Tips**

Offers detailed DIY tips and tutorials for repairing or upcycling clothes, helping users extend the life of their wardrobe and reduce waste. Topics include mending holes, replacing buttons, and adjusting fit.

### 16. **Brand Transparency Alerts**

Users receive notifications when a brand’s sustainability rating changes, whether due to new practices or public scandals. The app also highlights when new brands receive high sustainability scores, making it easier to shop ethically.

### 17. **Donation Box Reminders**

Users create a virtual "donation box" where they add items they plan to donate. The app sends periodic reminders to ensure users follow through, helping them declutter effectively and avoid letting unused clothes accumulate. Users can also browse each others' donation boxes to help clothes find a new home.

### 18. **Clothing Repair Network**

Users can access a network of local tailors or repair shops, making it easy to repair damaged clothing and also support local small businesses. Users can also share DIY tips and tutorials with the community, encouraging repairs rather than replacements.

### 19. **Style Circles**

Users can join or create small style circles where they share fashion ideas, trade clothes, and motivate each other to embrace minimalism and sustainability. These circles help users build a supportive community around ethical fashion.

### 20. **Closet Detox Timer**

The app encourages users to schedule regular closet detox sessions. It provides a step-by-step guide for decluttering, helping users decide what to keep, donate, or recycle. The feature promotes ongoing wardrobe maintenance and sustainability.

### 21. **Carbon Offset Purchasing**

Users can choose to offset the environmental impact of their fashion purchases by contributing to carbon offset programs. After purchasing an item, the app calculates the carbon footprint and suggests how much to contribute to offset the impact (e.g., planting trees or funding renewable energy).

### 22. **Sustainable Clothing Rental**

Users can rent clothing from others within the ReWear community for special events (like suits, prom dresses, Halloween costumes), reducing the need for one-time purchases.

### 23. **Outfit Rewind**

This feature shows users how they’ve styled specific items in the past (via the OOTD section or tracked wear history). It helps users revisit and reuse older outfits by offering inspiration based on past looks, encouraging creativity with existing clothes.

## VSD Analysis

### Insight 1: Stakeholders - Non-Targeted Use: Reselling for Profit

Observation: Users might repurpose the app for unplanned/nefarious purposes, such as purchasing second-hand clothes for cheap and reselling them for profit, or lying about the quality of clothes they are selling to scam other users.

Design Response: Implement a reporting mechanism where community members can flag suspicious or exploitative behavior. Additionally, emphasize ethical consumption by educating users on the environmental impact of over-purchasing, even second-hand goods. We could also potentially disallow monetary transactions on the app to prevent people from exploiting it for ulterior motives.

### Insight 2: Stakeholders - One Person, Multiple Roles

Observation: A user might initially be a consumer looking for second-hand clothing but later switch roles to a donor looking to declutter and give away items. These dual roles mean the app needs to serve both functions seamlessly.

Design Response: Create a streamlined flow for switching between roles, allowing users to easily toggle between "donation mode" and "shopping mode" without confusion, or create separate pages for the different flows. Ensure that both experiences are equally smooth and rewarding, with features like item tracking for donors and eco-friendly ratings for buyers.

### Insight 3: Values - User Experience of Values

Observation: If widely adopted, the app could foster a cultural shift towards sustainable fashion and minimalism, reducing the demand for fast fashion. However, there is a risk of users feeling pressured to always "do the right thing" and experiencing eco-anxiety if they don’t meet sustainability goals.

Design Response: To mitigate potential guilt or anxiety, the app should have a supportive tone and promote progress over perfection. Users could receive positive reinforcement for small steps toward sustainability, while educational content should emphasize that every effort counts.

### Insight 4: Pervasiveness - Diverse Geographies (Urban vs. Rural Fashion and Community Needs)

Observation: Fashion trends, community needs, and sustainability practices may differ greatly between urban and rural settings. Urban users might have access to trendy second-hand stores and fast shipping, while rural users may have fewer fashion options and prioritize practical, durable clothing over aesthetics.

Design Response: Develop location-based community hubs within the app, where urban users can share style inspiration, while rural users focus on practicality and resourcefulness (e.g., upcycling, durable clothing). Offer region-specific guides on how to repair or extend the life of clothing based on what’s locally available.

### Insight 5: Time – Reappropriation Beyond Clothing to Sustainable Lifestyles

Observation: Once ReWear reaches widespread use, it might be reappropriated to support a broader sustainability movement. Communities could use the app for organizing sustainable living swaps (e.g., trading eco-friendly home goods) or creating a marketplace for other second-hand items, beyond fashion.

Design Response: Introduce an "Eco-Exchange" section of the app where users can swap, donate, or purchase sustainable lifestyle products (e.g., homeware, books, kitchen goods). This reappropriation would expand the platform’s mission to support a circular economy beyond just fashion.

## Storyboarding and Sketching

Storyboarding and sketching. To help you figure out how to winnow down your feature brainstorm into a more cohesive application, identify 2–3 key user “flows” each of which comprises a series of actions a user must take to fulfill a goal that they have. For each flow, produce a storyboard: a sequence of annotated sketches that begins by depicting a user’s motivation for forming the goal, and then shows the actions they must perform with a UI (and how the UI responds) for accomplishing the goal.

For example, flows for an online bookstore might include: looking for a book; ordering a book; returning a book; and so on. A storyboard for “looking for a book” might begin by showing a user hoping for some escapism. Then, across a series of steps, the storyboard would depict how they would move through the application to identify a potentially set of subjects or genres of interest, and then winnow down to specific books they find interesting. These steps would show how a user would manipulate the user interface (e.g., what buttons would they press), how the user interface would respond (e.g., filtering down the list of books), and how a user would make sense of what was shown.

As you put together the storyboards, note down things that feel brittle or unclear about the flow—these will serve as fodder to prompt your work in the next (convergent) phase of the design process.
