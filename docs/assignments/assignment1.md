# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

> ## Hunch ü§î
>
> **How does social media impact/encourage hyperconsumerism, specifically in the fashion space? How can social media be used to promote more sustainable behaviors?**

## Background

During my freshman and sophomore years of college, I bought a lottt of clothes, but every time I opened my closet, I felt like I had nothing to wear. When moving out, I realized that a lot of the clothes I had purchased were not high quality, and were purchased to match trends that had since gone out of date, or that I never was really that into in the first place. I had bought a lot of clothes from fast-fashion brands like Yesstyle that hadn't lasted, and I realized that social media played a big part into my desire to keep buying more things - not just clothes, but also gadgets, new devices, skincare, makeup, and more.

Trends like dropshipping have recently shot up in popularity, with social media being the biggest tool for growing their markets. I've seen tons of Instagram accounts that advertise gadgets and clothing articles like [example], [example], and [example] as being homemade/handcrafted, when instead they are shipped from overseas with a huge markup in price.

In that sense, I want to explore how social media has impacted or encouraged hyperconsumerism, and how it might be improved to promote more sustainable behaviors, to find a way for people to be both dripped out and sustainable.

## Interview Preparation

### Interviewee Selection üë§

Based on my hunch, I identified **two main demographics** of people I wanted to interview: [**fashion enthusiasts**](#fashion-enthusiast-Ô∏è), and [**conscious consumers**](#conscious-consumer-Ô∏è).

Additionally, I wanted to interview one male and one female, and people of different age demographics, since I imagine social media would impact their buying trends in different ways.

#### Fashion Enthusiast üõçÔ∏è‚ú®üõí

A "fashion enthusiast" would be someone who actively engages with fashion-related content on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Pinterest, and regularly follows trends, engages in fashion discussions, or makes frequent purchases. This person would be able to provide insight into how social media shapes their purchasing habits, or reinforces buying behavior through ads, trends, and sponsored content.

#### Conscious Consumer ‚ôªÔ∏èüëñüåç

A "conscious consumer" would be someone who has actively chosen to either reduce their social media use for environmental reasons, or someone who is conscious about sustainable fashion. This person might be able to offer a contrasting perspective on how social media might be adapted to support less consumption-oriented behaviors or may highlight frustrations with how current platforms fail to do so.

My **conscious consumer** is Sophie, a 54-year-old software engineer from Andover, MA, who [insert bio]
