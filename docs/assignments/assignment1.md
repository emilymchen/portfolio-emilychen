# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

> ## Hunch 🤔
>
> **How does social media impact/encourage hyperconsumerism, specifically in the fashion space? How can social media be used to promote more sustainable behaviors?**

## Background

During my freshman and sophomore years of college, I bought a lottt of clothes, but every time I opened my closet, I felt like I had nothing to wear. When moving out, I realized that a lot of the clothes I had purchased were not high quality, and were purchased to match trends that had since gone out of date, or that I never was really that into in the first place. I had bought a lot of clothes from fast-fashion brands like Yesstyle that hadn't lasted, and I realized that social media played a big part into my desire to keep buying more things - not just clothes, but also gadgets, new devices, skincare, makeup, and more.

Trends like dropshipping have recently shot up in popularity, with social media being the biggest tool for growing their markets. I've seen [tons of Instagram accounts](https://www.wired.com/story/dropshipping-instagram-ads/) that advertise gadgets and clothing articles like jewelry, scarves, and dresses as being homemade/handcrafted, when [instead they are shipped from oversea mass-production factories with a huge markup in price](https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2023/05/17/etsy-dropshipping-knockoffs/).

In that sense, I want to explore how social media has impacted or encouraged hyperconsumerism, and how it might be improved to promote more sustainable behaviors, to find a way for people to be both dripped out and sustainable.

## Interview Preparation

### Interviewee Selection 👤

Based on my hunch, I identified **two main demographics** of people I wanted to interview: [**fashion enthusiasts**](#fashion-enthusiast-️), and [**conscious consumers**](#conscious-consumer-️).

Additionally, I wanted to interview one male and one female, and people of different age demographics, since I imagine social media would impact their buying trends in different ways.

#### Fashion Enthusiast 🛍️✨🛒

A "fashion enthusiast" would be someone who actively engages with fashion-related content on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Pinterest. This person would be able to provide insight into how social media shapes their purchasing/fashion habits.

My **fashion enthusiast** is Z, an avid traveler, dancer, tinkerer, engineer.

#### Conscious Consumer ♻️👖🌍

A "conscious consumer" would be someone who has actively chosen to either reduce their social media use for environmental reasons, or someone who is conscious about their purchasing habits. This person might be able to offer a contrasting perspective on how social media might be adapted to support less consumption-oriented behaviors or may highlight frustrations with how current platforms fail to do so.

My **conscious consumer** is Sophie, a 54-year-old software engineer from Andover, MA, who likes to eat, cook, and run marathons in her free time.

### Interview Plan

#### Rough Structure

1. **Introductions (5 min):** Introduce myself + the overarching goal of the interview (without giving too many details so as not to skew their responses), and get to know the interviewees -- hobbies, professions, interests, etc.
2. **Social Media in Daily Life (10 min):** Ask about their general social media use; have them open one of their most-used apps and see what they would generally do on a regular basis.
3. **Fashion/Shopping Habits (20 min):** Focus on storytelling, allowing them to narrate experiences about social media’s impact on their fashion-related behaviors.

#### Guiding Questions

-   Can you tell me a bit about yourself? (interests, hobbies, profession, etc)
-   What social media platforms do you use the most? Why do you use these over others?
    -   Follow-up: How much time do you spend daily on these platforms? How do you feel about the time you spend on social media?
-   Can you describe or demonstrate what it’s like when you open that social media platform for the first time each day? What do you usually end up doing?
-   Do you have any routines or habits with how or when you check social media throughout the day? How do you feel about those habits?
-   Is there anything about how you use social media that has changed over time, or things that you want to change? What prompted those changes/desire for change?
-   Where do you generally buy your clothes from? Do you tend to shop at the same stores, or explore new brands? How do you find new stores/brands to shop at?
-   Can you tell me about any fashion influencers or brands on social media that you follow? What about their content resonates with you?
-   Are there any specific fashion trends that you're really into right now, or really don't like? Do you look for specific styles, brands, or trends when you’re using social media?
-   How do you feel fashion on social media helps you express yourself? Do you feel like the content you see helps you define your personal style?
-   Have you ever changed your style or wardrobe based on something you saw on social media? How did that change make you feel?
-   How do you balance seeing trends for new things on social media with your goal of decluttering and owning less? Has it ever created tension for you?
-   Have you ever regretted buying something after seeing it on social media because it didn’t align with your goal of decluttering? What was that experience like?
-   When you see fashion content on social media, do you ever feel like it encourages you to accumulate more? How do you handle those feelings?

## Interview Reports

### Interview with Z ([link to raw notes](/z-interview))

> #### "60% of the time, I just don't like the clothes anymore and wouldn't wear them again. I would rather them find a new home."

Z is a senior at MIT, double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Music, with a focus on product design. He's from Brooklyn, NY, and [does a little bit of everything](https://zhixing-chen.com/) from [travel](https://www.instagram.com/zheeeeeeeeeeeee/) to dance to activities in nature like surfing and snowboarding. Although he spends a lot of time engaging with content related to travel and dance on social media, fashion content plays a role in shaping his sense of style.

Z mainly uses Instagram to document his own travel experiences and look for new places to visit, but also interacts with fashion content on the platform. Although he doesn't actively seek out specific brands or follow fashion influencers, he frequently watches fashion-related posts like ["get ready with me"](https://www.vogue.com/article/tiktok-get-ready-with-me-videos) videos and styling inspiration. He doesn't feel a need to copy someone's look, but people's outfits and style ideas stick in the back of his mind if he really likes them, influencing his future clothing purchases. Fashion for Z is more about collecting inspiration rather than following trends explicitly.

However, he has been buying fewer clothes recently, since he has accumulated more clothes than needed in the past. He told me about how he recently donated eight huge bags of clothes at the end of the summer that he was getting rid of for various reasons: they were too small, worn out, dirty, or more commonly, he just didn't like them anymore and wouldn't wear them. He also expressed frustrations with [how difficult it is to responsibly get rid of old clothes](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-get-rid-of-old-clothes/) -- there was a huge line to sell to thrift stores, and thrift stores are "really picky about what clothes they buy from you". He ended up donating his clothes somewhere but has no idea if they would get put to use or would simply get thrown away.

### Interview with Sophie ([link to raw notes](/sophie-interview))

> #### "I feel cluttered in my brain and daily life."

Sophie is a 54-year-old software engineer from Andover, MA, with a love for food and fitness. I thought she would be able to provide a perspective from an older generation. While she enjoys social media as a way to stay connected and consume content about her interests -- cooking, eating, working out, and [running marathons](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24902161) -- she's become increasingly frustrated by its impact on her daily life.

Sophie mainly chats with her friends on WeChat, watches English videos on Youtube, and watches short-video content on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). However, although she uses social media every day (reportedly spending an hour on Xiaohongshu and 1-2 hours on Youtube a day), I was struck by how negative her sentiments towards social media were. She described a lot of the content on Xiaohongshu as **"useless, addictive, and a total waste of time."** Youtube is better, but even there, she often finds herself mindlessly scrolling through shorts, leaving her feeling fatigued.

> ### "Xiaohongshu said I would feel cool if I wear it."

Sophie’s frustration extends to her shopping habits. Influenced by short-form videos on Xiaohongshu, she’s made purchases she later regretted, particularly from trendy brands like Engine Bird and Shein. The clothes often didn’t fit well or lacked quality, leaving her feeling disappointed and disillusioned, but now with additional clutter in her life. She told me more recently how she's trying to make a more conscious effort to shift toward high-quality, timeless pieces, hoping to declutter her life. Nowadays, she only buys from established brands she trusts, such as Ann Taylor for her work clothes, and Tracksmith and RCI for sports clothes.

> ### "When I see short videos recommending new ways of doing makeup, I want to buy all the makeup."

Throughout the interview, I could really sense how all the clutter she had accummulated from excessive shopping had affected her, and she also compared these feelings to how overwhelmed she sometimes feels with the sheer amount of content on Xiaohongshu. She told me that despite her wishes to live a decluttered and minimalistic life, social media still triggered her urge to buy things she didn't need, especially when she saw trendy items like running shoes or makeup tutorials. Even more strikingly, she also admitted that she would sometimes buy clothes online, only to leave the package unopened for months on end, emphasizing even further that these purchases really weren't necessary. I was really struck by the tensions that arose throughout the interview; she was constantly battling conflicting emotions between her desire to declutter, and her desire to buy new things, to the point where she had tons of strategies for preventing herself from shopping, such as asking herself at least 3 times whether she really needs something before she buys it. Ultimately, her relationship with social media is complex: while it influences her shopping decisions and consumes a significant portion of her day, she also recognizes its downsides and is actively trying to shift towards a more minimal, intentional lifestyle.

## Design Opportunities

At a high level, I found that both Z and Sophie's frustrations with social media centered around balancing a desire for less clutter, with a desire to still stay fashionable and wear nice clothes. This inspired me to think about a social media platform that allows users to explore and develop their sense of fashion, while also staying mindful about purchasing habits, and helps users donate clothes they don't use anymore.

Below are some potential design opportunities based on these factors.

### 1. Local Clothing Donation Feature

This would be a feature that allows users to easily find local donation centers, or to give clothes for free to other users in their local community, so they can find new homes for clothes they no longer use.

Z mentioned donating large amounts of clothes but felt unsure about their ultimate destination. This feature would guide users towards sustainable repurposing of clothes, which would help them feel more confident that their old clothes are being reused rather than ending up in landfills.

### 2. OOTD (Outfit Of The Day) Section

An OOTD section would encourage users to showcase how they wear their existing clothes in different ways, mixing and matching items to form new outfits. This section would focus on maximizing the utility of existing wardrobe pieces rather than promoting new purchases, and would also allow users to draw inspiration from each other in developing their individual style.

Both Z and Sophie are trying to reduce how much they buy, but still want to stay stylish. This feature would allow users to express their sense of fashion without buying new items constantly.

### 3. Emphasis on a Minimalist Social Media Experience

I would want to focus the platform to prioritize a minimalist style, with a more stripped-down feed with fewer ads/trend-driven content. Users could also filter out cluttered content like excessive product recommendations, giving them a lot of control over how they set up their personal social media browsing experience.

Sophie expressed a lot of frustration with the overwhelming amount of content on Xiaohongshu and wanted a less cluttered experience; a minimalistic design could reduce decision fatigue and help users engage more meaningfully with the content that really matters to them.

### 4. Forum for Connecting and Discussing Clothing Quality and Sustainability

This section would be dedicated towards open discussion about quality and sustainability in different clothing companies. Sophie said a lot of the recommendations for brands she had seen on social media didn't feel honest, so this section would focus on promoting critical discussion so users can learn from each other to buy clothing pieces that really last. This would allow them to make meaningful purchases and get more wears out of their clothes.

This section could also include things like quality scores or sustainability scores for clothing companies or even individual clothing articles, along with calculating things like the price per wear for a piece of clothing, encouraging users to make better investments in clothing they will be able to wear for a long time.
