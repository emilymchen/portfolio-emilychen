# Lec 15 Blog: Designs That Matter

In lecture on Wednesday, Lyel asked us two simple questions: “How positively has the internet affected you as an individual?” and “How positively has the internet affected society?”

Answering didn’t quite feel so simple: the internet has done so much for advancing and progressing society and people’s quality of life, but has also had incredible negative consequences in other ways. It felt impossible to sum up the impact on a single scale from 0 to 5.

I was reminded of a project I did in high school about Fritz Haber, the German chemist who invented the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. This single discovery revolutionized the production of fertilizer, which allowed crop yields to skyrocket to the point that it’s estimated that 2 in 5 people today owe their lives to its invention. But the same process laid the foundation for explosives used in two world wars, and Haber even weaponized his knowledge for chemical warfare. His invention both fed and killed millions. So how positively did it affect society?

From the synthesis of ammonia to the invention of the internet to the creation of Facebook, it’s hard to point to a single invention as being either “good” or “bad” for society, but with each invention comes a profound moral responsibility that is ignored by a lot of inventors.

There’s often a huge economic pressure to move quickly, bring products to market, and push the boundaries of what’s possible within tech, but often at the expense of ethics and value considerations. It’s our responsibility though to balance this pressure for speed with careful thought and restraint, and to create safeguards to prevent or mitigate misuse of our inventions.

The thought of all of this pressure and potential consequences honestly felt really overwhelming/paralyzing to me. How could a single individual make a difference in a huge company while handling all of these pressures? But I’d like to think that Lyel’s quote from Richard Feynman, “direction is more important than speed,” applies here as well: we don’t need to be perfect or solve every problem immediately, but every small decision can move the needle in the right direction is still worthwhile.
