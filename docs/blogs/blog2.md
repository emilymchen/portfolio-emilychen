# Project Pitches Blog

Language is more than just a means of communication; it’s a cornerstone that encapsulates some of the most important parts of different cultures, identities, and history, and really shapes a lot of how we think and learn growing up, which is why I was really inspired by M2G2’s idea for an endangered language preservation app. Their app idea not only sheds light on the reality of language extinction but also offers a thoughtful solution to empower communities to perpetuate their linguistic heritage moving forward.

As I reflected on their concept, a few questions and suggestions came to mind that might help make the app even more impactful moving forward!

## Who will use the app?

Thinking about the diverse users who could benefit from an endangered language app, on one end of the spectrum would be elderly members of a community who might be among the last fluent speakers of a language. For them, a simple and intuitive user interface would be critical to make the documentation process of a language easy, through features such as voice recordings or text input with automated phonetic transcription. This would encourage their participation by making the documentation process as smooth as possible.

However, on the other end of the spectrum are children and young learners within a community. Incorporating resources like interactive children’s stories, games, or even songs could make the language more engaging for kids, which would help ensure that languages are passed down through generations.

## Pronunciation guides

Learning the sounds of a language are just as important, if not more so, than learning words and their meanings themselves. Thus, it would be critical to include things like pronunciation guides or phonetic breakdowns that would make the app an even more powerful learning tool. For example, users could record themselves and compare their pronunciation to native speakers.

## Connections

I personally find that speaking and practicing regularly is one of the best ways to learn a language, so it would be great to see an app like this include a way for users to connect with other speakers of the language. Whether through chat, voice calls, or some other form of group learning, adding in this type of community support would help users connect with each other and practice speaking out loud, as well as help learners stay motivated.

## Culture through language

Language is also often deeply tied to traditions, stories, and songs, all of which are also at danger of being lost through the extinction of language. It would be super cool to see the app include the ability for users to share things like their native stories and songs through the app as a form of preservation. This would also make the app much more culturally rich, and over the years could create a digital archive of oral histories that future generations could access.

## Lightweight app or offline version

This might not be super feasible given the constraints of this class, but since a lot of endangered language communities face technological barriers such as limited internet access or older devices, offering a lightweight app version or offline functionality would make the app more accessible and inclusive for those users.

Overall, I’m really excited by the idea of an endangered language app and I’m looking forward to seeing how it turns out! It’s a really unique idea and has some great potential to make meaningful change in language preservation.
