# Response to Cameron's Blog

I really enjoyed Cameron’s blog post on more potential ways to enact change with a company apart from the one-for-one model that Tom’s uses, especially since on the surface, Tom’s business model sounds really appealing as a consumer, but as discussed in lecture, can result in a lot of unintended consequences.

Hearing about more ways that companies can try to make a positive impact to align their incentives with the good of their stakeholders was also really enlightening, and I really liked the comparison between treating symptoms vs causes vs restoring health. I think one of the reasons why one-for-one models like Tom’s can find so much success is because of how tangible and concrete the impact seems for consumers: rather than a more vague statement saying that money from their purchase will help people, they know exactly what their purchase will contribute. However, this isn’t the best way to make an impact, and having a more flexible and scalable solution results in greater potential good.

It’s interesting to think about how businesses can try to strike a balance between these: creating a tangible connection for consumers while also implementing solutions that are genuinely impactful and scalable. While models like Warby Parker’s longer-term infrastructure or TNH’s micro-loan strategy might not feel as immediately gratifying to consumers, they can have a much deeper and more sustainable impact in the long run.

Companies could also consider how to best communicate these more complex models to their audiences. It might require more effort to explain the benefits of long-term investments in local economies, but storytelling and transparency behind the model could help bridge that gap and help consumers feel more connected to the broader mission.

Especially given the rise in popularity of things like green-washing, where companies are only superficially good for the environment, it’s important as consumers to be able to distinguish between companies who are really making an impact. Thanks for the thoughtful blog post and for shedding some light on alternatives!
