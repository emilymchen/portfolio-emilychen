1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself? (interests, hobbies, profession, etc)

likes food, like running, marathons, likes travel, thats it

2. What social media platforms do you use the most? Why do you use these over others?

wechat, xiao hong shu, youtube\
language: xiao hong shu is mostly chinese, wechat mostly connect in chinese community, lack of english culture there\
youtube for english stuff\
member of youtube so can play videos, lots of information, can be played in background, xiao hong shu cannot\
shorter videos always give you too many recommended videos related to it

wechat for chatting, xiao hong shu and youtube, more youtube than xiao hong shu

3. What type of content do you normally consume on social media?

watch all kinds of things, sports-related, food-related, gym-related, weightlifting, worst thing is soap operas/short drama, no brainer, can put it in the background and put to sleep\
xiaohongshu is looking for chinese way to cook things, chinese things\
bad part is it gives you some content that you really dont think is great content, its a waste of time\
youtube is better; xiaohongshu has too many videos\

4. Follow-up: How much time do you spend daily on these platforms? How do you feel about the time you spend on social media?

xiaohongshu, before you know can spend 1-2 hours on it\
normally gets tired of it, really dont like it, total waste of time, addictive\

youtube spends longer time because can be played at background\
spend at least 3 hours on youtube, youtube is a little better unless you do youtube shorts, most is a waste of time

5. Do you have any routines or habits with how or when you check social media throughout the day? How do you feel about those habits?

when really need to focus, listen to music on spotify\
if dont need to focus, play some videos in background, sometimes can be food-related, no-brainer (as in not requiring brainpower) videos\
look at shorts when get up, when eating lunch, when eating dinner\
watch videos to fall asleep

6. Is there anything about how you use social media that has changed over time, or things that you want to change? What prompted those changes/desire for change?

trying to use less since waste of time, not valuable content

7. Where do you generally buy your clothes from? Do you tend to shop at the same stores, or explore new brands? How do you find new stores/brands to shop at?

shop at normal stores, buy work clothes at ann taylor, these kinds of places\
buy sports clothes at rci or nike

know sizing of brands, know they have good quality, but quality is even getting worse and worse

dont need to dress up too mcuh anymore lol bc she thinks shes old \
mostly buy sports clothes, buy from tracksmith and lululemon

8. How do you feel about your shopping habits?

see other people wear something cool, she does want to get it\
generally have too much stuff\
when she sees new shoes, new edition, new version, really likes to get it, but waits a little bit for it to go on sale
for sports clothes

it’s two things: \
if really need urgently, dont care about price and just buy. \
if dont need urgently, wait for it to go on sale and buy a lot, but feels bad about buying a lot

9. Follow-up: why do you feel bad about buying things even if they're on sale?

tends to buy things she doesnt need

10. Follow-up: why buy things you dont need?

commercials/advertisements\
read xiaohongshu and people say things are very good\
last time bought some enginebird (chinese brand) because xiaohongshu said you feel cool when you wear it. feel so cool and things american friends dont have, so bought those\
social media does have an effect for her, mostly short videos recommending new ways of doing makeup, wants to get all the makeup

11. Have you ever regretted buying something after seeing it on social media because it didn’t align with your goal of decluttering? What was that experience like?

one time, friend recommended shein; bought it and much smaller and not what she expected\
sizing is off, stopped buying it

12. Do you think recommendations on social media are honest?

dont think its honest

13. Are you trying to make any changes in your shopping habits?

try to buy less, but quality and timeless stuff\
try to get rid of stuff and buy less stuff\
if buy stuff, more and more quality vs quantity\
every single piece is very nice\
gradually get rid of old stuff

14. What made you want to make that change?

clutter. too many things. just like internet, xiao hong shu is cluttered too. dont want to have a cluttered life. feel very cluttered in the brain and in daily life.

15. How do you balance seeing trends for new things on social media with your goal of decluttering and owning less? Has it ever created tension for you?

its hard. especially for her, use a lot of sports stuff, have to ask herself 3 times if she really needs it. \
if she really needs it, ok go ahead, but get rid of one of the old stuff.\

if she really needs it and can afford it? \
urge to buy but when it arrives, leave it unopened for half a year. she really doesnt need them and can use the money for other things\

try to get rid of stuff before buying new stuff\
when see bunch of things she likes, put in the cart for a little bit, and then come revisit and reduce it and only buy two or three items at most\
two things: one is budget, two is does she need the item\
even if she has the budget / good value, if she really doesnt need it, she doesnt buy it\
should put away your money, dont have enough money in bank account helps --> make the money not available to spend
