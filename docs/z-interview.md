big solo traveler, love seeing new people \
free time - likes to sing, dance, songwrite, surf, snowboard, nature activities

2. What social media platforms do you use the most? Why do you use these over others?

mainly instagram, when traveling likes to take stories of it and post on there, nice memories. mainly insta, also facebook messenger to stay in touch with friends, communicate \
whatsapp in europe \
dont use facebook to post, only post on insta \
snapchat to talk to ppl \
xiao hong shu for recommendations for countries for restaurants/itineraries, good picks bc asians pick
best restaurants, used in mexico

doomscroll, youtube shorts, media consumption\
integrated shorts into youtube\
used to have tiktok but deleted it when went to ireland, but maybe still downloaded?\
lots of dance from all over the world, making choreo, grooving to things like lessons
lots of traveling, lots of food, new destinations, folders where save food, hikes to go on, places to see\
some nerdy stuff, mit posts stuff, some fashion stuff\
some artsy stuff\
something crazy - recently found out instagram rolled out feature where on first page, you stop seeing your friends and instead see other recommended content\
slowly happened, didnt even know\
dream job TRAVELING AND POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA :DD\

one feature was trying to do on insta but couldnt - in france, wanted to look for dance classes, but rly difficult. trying to use hashtags to search but apparently can only have one?\
e.g. #paris #dance search doesn't work \

havnet shopped in a while D:: too many clothes now, rly focused on traveling\
don’t look for brands, just pieces he sees from random places when shopping\
when you see something that would work, you think about it and buy it\
wardrobe has a bunch of random stuff from diff places\
zara in diff countries\
see content like get ready with mes, people styling different things that gives inspiration\
wouldnt necessarily be like i wanna be like that, but if you see image, itll stay in back of head\
stockpiling clothes and not doing things with old clothes and buying new ones\
has been buying less, so that’s been changing a little bit, so more money for other things\

recently organizing everything at home to bring, and managed to pack 8 giant bags of clothes size of big chair; donated it !!\
half of it are clothes are too small or too old, some of them are too dirty, mainly 60% of time it’s just don't like them anymore and wouldn't wear them again\

see a lot of products he wants to buy; advertising is pretty good\
mudwtr - coffee alternative, but $40 for mushroom water lol for pack of 30\
bought like 7 orders on amazon\

places to travel to\
social media affects that a lot\
the more he sees, the more it stays in his head\
friends recommendations, from school or from traveling\
want to go somewhere, depends on prices, and if he knows anyone there that’s a plus

expectations vs reality,\
when people post a lot about locations, get there at times when there’s no one, but when you get there there’s tons of people\
favorite parts about traveling, meeting new people, learning new cultures, seeing different scenery, taking in fresh air\
